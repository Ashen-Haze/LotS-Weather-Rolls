## **Temperature**
- Measured in Fahrenheit
- Weekly temperature average depends on the season
- Daily high and low points will be 5-10 degrees from weekly average

## **Wind**
- 1/3 chance to occur
- Varies in strength (weighted equally)
  - Low
  - Moderate
  - High
- Effect varies by location
  - Greater effect on Meteorclan and Cascadeclan territories
  - Lesser effect on Twilightclan and neutral territories
- Temperature feels colder when strength > low

## **Precipitation**

  - Light
  - Moderate
  - Heavy
- Varies in duration (weighted equally)
  - Occasional
    - Cannot occur when amount = heavy
  - Sporadic
  - Constant
- Varies in type (weights shown)
